From B. (Bernd.Kreimeier@nero.uni-bonn.de), 1995

The following savegame info applies to DOOM 1.2. Perhaps only the
new shotgun data had been added in the weapons section. Dunno how
MAPxx vs. ExMx is handled.


In 1994, I had a quick check on the offsets in doomsged.pas, which was 
written by Nelson Fernandez Jr. (nelson@netcom.com). I found
two minor errors, but the offsets he is using are mostly correct:

Each player is described by a record of 276 bytes. Thus DSG
header size is (4*276) bytes for 4 player netgame. Some header
information is included only in the first record:

0x00 the savegame name, string (filled with zero if less then 24 byte)
0x18  version, as "version 102" (missing some upgrades...)

0x28 byte, 0-4, skill
0x29 byte, 1-3, episode
0x2a byte, 1-9, level

0x2b	// byte, should be flag for player0, always 1 ?
0x2c	// byte, player1 flag, 0 or 1
0x2d	// byte, player2 flag, 0 or 1 
0x2e	// byte, player3 flag, 0 or 1


For each player, the following offsets to the base player_num*276
(player_num = 0,1,2 or 3) I've checked:

0x52  current health, dword, 1-199
0x56  current armor,  dword, 

0x5e  remaining time for PINV, dword
0x62   dito, PSTR, dword
0x66  PINS
0x6a  SUIT

0x6e  PMAP (computer map) dword, 0-1 flag

0x72  PVIS, remaining time again; dword
0x76  BKEY, dword, 0 or 1
0x7a  YKEY
0x7e  RKEY  (haven't checked each key)
0x82  BSKU
0x86  YSKU
0x8a  RSKU

0xae  pistol availability flag, dword, 0 or 1
0xb2  shotgun
0xb6  chaingun
0xba  rocket launcher
0xbe  plasma rifle
0xc2  BFG9000
0xc6  Chainsaw   (all those weren't completely right in doomsged.pas)

??? new shotgun somewhere here ???

0xca current amount of bullets, dword, 0-0xFFFFFFFF
0xce shells
0xd2 rockets
0xd6 cells

0xda current maximum amount of bullets the player may carry
0xde shells
0xe2 rockets
0xe6 cells  (all these are used instead of a backpack flag...)

0xf2 cheat modes, dword, several bits
		NOCLIP_FLAG = 0x01;	// idspispopd
		GOD_FLAG    = 0x02;	// iddqd
		SLOW_FLAG   = 0x04;	// crawl mode, not tested yet

0x10e colorshift, dword, 0-0xFFFFFFFF, known as "Acid" or "Freak" Mode,
		have seen it (as well as the crawl Mode) with other
		Savegame edits.  The DOOMSGED author states:
		
  >>There used to be an AcidWarp function that would let you play while the
  game cycled colors. I think this may have been a function to be used
  originally by 24-bit true color cards. I named it AcidWarp because it 
  was phsychedelic!<<

Remarks: automap state (map on/off, follow on/off, grid on/off, as
well as iddt, iddtiddt) aren't in the DSG.

It seems at offset 0x30/0060  there's a timer. Might be
"Time sucks" counter.  Haven't looked at the time scale,
which should be identical to power-up expiration.
DOOMSGED is based on the assumption that  90 minutes
are equivalent to 0xFFFFFFFF  *or* 0xFFFFFF (dunno which,
haven't bothered to examine the source that close). I'm not
convinced.

Offset 0x32 seems to be different for the same map,
dependend on skill & nomonster == number of things?
Based on the DSF file size for same map, different skills,
Matt Fell concluded DOOM uses 151 bytes/thing. Thus there is
obviously more information here than in the THINGS resource.

Note that angle and position of player aren't within the
276 bytes record. He's probably treated as any other
thing in that aspect. Haven't seen current weapon either,
should be within the first 276 bytes as well.

Offset 0340, perhaps a counter?


Not found:

 - doors, switches, elevators, stairs, crushers, light levels
 - item picked/available
 - projectiles/teleport fog/respawn fog
 - current state of thing (animation/damage)
 - lindefs seen on automap
 - items/kills gained counter (if any)
  

Failsafe procedure to get rid of the "savegame buffer overflow":

a)  S = Savegame buffer size = 64 KB (?).
b)    minus NH = 4*267 bytes for 4 player netgame header.
c)    minus ES = DSG size using an emtpy THING resource
       (includes required player starts only)
      plus 276 (single player header)
d)  (S - NH - ES + 276)/ 151 == NoOf_Things still available.
e)  Now add at max NoOf_Things things to your map.

Remember the number of things might increase (projectiles, MAP30).

Beware: haven't checked this since 1.2, no warranty :-).
