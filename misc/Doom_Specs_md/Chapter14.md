# APPENDIX [A-4]: Other helpful documents

  There are several other excellent sources of information about
DOOM, editing DOOM levels, changing the DOOM.EXE, and pwads.
Some of the following items get widely distributed (BBS, Usenet,
online services, FTP) and some don't. Three prominent FTP sites
with huge quantities of doom-related material are:

```
    infant2.sphs.indiana.edu    /pub/doom and subdirectories
                                  (../wad_edit/text has most documents)
    wuarchive.wustl.edu         /pub/msdos_uploads/games/doomstuff
    ftp.uwp.edu                 /pub/incoming/id
                                /pub/msdos/games/id/home-brew/doom
```

  The infant2 site also has a number of mirrors.
  As time passes, newer versions of these documents may be released,
and/or the file names will change:

DESIGN12.ZIP    Level Design FAQ, edited by Tom Neff
                  Truly has lots of good questions, and good answers,
                  to common questions related to level design. Covers
                  the simple stuff, and some of the most advanced
                  topics too. Also, it is editor-nuetral, i.e. it
                  does not restrict itself to any single level editor.
                  Highly recommended.

                  allows changes to be made to the DOOM.EXE file and
                  they can be saved/loaded via patch files. The thing
                  and frame tables (discussed in chapter [10]) are the
                  main emphasis of this excellent utility.
